# VideoMaker
This just automates making tiktok compilations (like the ones you see on youtube). 
You can use this to make videos for your own amusement, or post it where you please.

# How do I install the dependencies? 
## If you are using a Debian-based distribution:
```bash
$ sudo apt install ffmpeg jq youtube-dl
```
On other distributions, install the corresponding packages (usually called the same).

# How do I run this?

```bash
$ chmod +x videomaker.sh
$ ./videomaker.sh
```
#Whats the roadmap for this thing?
I plan on automating video uploading, and haveing it post every set amount of days. If you have ideas, make a pull request.

# I want new features! This thing is broken!
If it breaks make issue, or if you want new features, create a pull request.
