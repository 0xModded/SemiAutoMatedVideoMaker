# VideoMaker
This just automates making tiktok compilations (like the ones you see on youtube). 
You can use this to make videos for your own amusement, or post it where you please.

# How do I install the dependencies? 
## If you are using a Debian-based distribution:
```bash
$ sudo apt update 
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install ffmpeg 
$ sudo apt install jq 
$ sudo apt install youtube-dl
```
On other distributions, install the corresponding packages (usually called the same).

# How do I run this?

```bash
$ chmod +x videomaker.sh
$ ./videomaker.sh
```

# I want new features! This thing is broken!
If it breaks make issue, or if you want new features, create a pull request.
